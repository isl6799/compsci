<h5>Sawmill Gravy</h5>
<p> Used in Southern United States cuisines, this thick sauce is simmered on a cast iron skillet and served with sizzling juicy sausage. Why is it called ‘SawMill’? Well In the early years of this sauce it originated in a log camp occupied by lumberjack sawmill workers. Cooks in this camp would stir up a steamy batch of gravy made simply with a cup of milk, flour, and a big bowl of corn-meal then it be  served to sauce-craving lumberjacks, who are exhausted from hefty woodchopping, would devour this delicious sauce to gain nutrition and strength to get the job done. </p>
